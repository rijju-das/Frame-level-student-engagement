## 📖 Overview

Student engagement varies over time during an online learning session—however, most public engagement datasets (especially video-based ones) provide only **video-level labels**, which can hide important engagement fluctuations across frames.

This repository provides code and extracted facial-feature datasets for **frame-level engagement classification** using **knowledge transfer**:

- A deep model is **pretrained** on a labeled *image-based* engagement dataset (**WACV**)
- The learned knowledge is then **transferred / adapted** to a *video-based* dataset (**DAiSEE**) to enable **frame-level engagement estimation**
- We also include baseline experiments using classical ML (e.g., **XGBoost**) on extracted facial features

The main focus of this project is **fine-grained (frame-level) engagement prediction** from facial behavior features.


## Executive summary
This project focuses on developing a robust student engagement detection system by leveraging facial features and video datasets. The main contributions include the introduction of a novel labeling methodology that captures the temporal dynamics of engagement within video frames, a comparative analysis highlighting the advantages of video datasets over image datasets in capturing engagement variations, and a comprehensive evaluation of all 712 facial features generated by OpenFace. The project aims to advance the field of student engagement detection and support educators in understanding students' levels of attention and interest. The GitHub repository provides the necessary resources for further research and collaboration in this domain.
## 🧠 Method Summary (High-Level)

1. **Feature extraction** (OpenFace)
   - Extract per-frame facial behavior features (Action Units, gaze, head pose, etc.)
2. **Source-domain learning**
   - Train model on the labeled **WACV image-based dataset**
3. **Knowledge transfer**
   - Transfer learned representations to the target dataset (**DAiSEE videos**)  
4. **Frame-level prediction**
   - Generate engagement predictions at the frame level for DAiSEE videos
## Code
All codes are written in python3 and can be found in ./Scripts.

* DataFormatter.py : DataFormatter class that prepares the input data for a machine learning model. It splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, reshapes the input features to include a third dimension, and performs one-hot encoding on the target labels. This ensures that the data is properly formatted and ready for training a model.
* XGB_pred.ipynb : The code performs tasks to train and evaluate an XGBoost classifier for student engagement prediction. 
* Tab_CNN.ipynb : 
This code appears to be a script for training and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on two different datasets: "WACV_train_data" and "DAiSEE_TL_data". The code builds a CNN model using the Keras library, trains it on the "WACV_train_data" dataset, evaluates its performance on the "DAiSEE_TL_data" dataset using transfer learning concepts.
